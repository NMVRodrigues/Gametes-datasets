# Gametes-datasets
A repository to store different gametes datasets.

The naming scheme is the following:
- **X**w: number of epistatic interactions, corresponds to the number of key features that need to be found in order to solve the problem.
- **X**a: number of total features of the dataset.
- **X**her: signal to noise ration, the higher the value the easier the problem is.

Contributions are always welcome.
